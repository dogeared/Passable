## On Passwords

Memorizing lots of passwords sucks.

Writing down passwords sucks.

Using the same password sucks.

Server side password solutions suck.

Two factor authentication is expensive.
And, therefore, sucks.

## How it works:

With Passable, you remember a long secret phrase that only you know. Something like:

```
The rain in spain falls mainly on the plain
(But make up your own)
```

Whenever you need a password, you use an account nickname. For instance, for a gmail account, the identifier might be:

```
gmail bob
(But make up your own)
```
